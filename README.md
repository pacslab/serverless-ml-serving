# MLProxy: SLA-Aware Reverse Proxy for Machine Learning Workloads

Codes, packages, experimentation results, and other artifacts for our SLA-Aware reverse proxy
paper. Using the proposed reverse proxy, developers can reduce the cost of deployment on
serverless computing platforms and improve the performance while making sure SLA objectives
are met in the process. For more information, please refer to our paper.

## Artifacts

Here is a list of artifacts for the proposed study:

- [Experiment Code for Deployment and Runtime](./experiments)
- [MLProxy's Code and Dockerfile for Reproducibility](./proxy)
- [Traces used for our experimentations](./traces)
- [Machine Learning Workloads Used For Our Experimentations](./workloads)
 
## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PIP
- Node 14.18.2+
- Docker
